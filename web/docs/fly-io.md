# Hosting and deploying to fly.io

## Create a fly.io account

1. Go to [fly.io](https://fly.io) and click on _Get Started_.
1. [Download and install](https://fly.io/docs/flyctl/installing/) the Fly CLI
1. From the command line, sign up for Fly: `flyctl auth signup`. You can sign up with an email address or with a GitHub account.
1. Fill in credit card information and click _Subscribe_.

## Build and deploy a container

1. Create an app using `flyctl launch`. You can choose your own app name or press enter to let Fly pick an app name. Choose a region for deployment (it should default to the closest one to you). Choose _No_ for DB. Choose _No_ to deploy now.
1. To create a new app in the Partner Dashboard or to link the app to an existing app, run the following command using your preferred package manager:

   Using yarn:

   ```shell
   yarn run info --web-env
   ```

   Using npm:

   ```shell
   npm run info --web-env
   ```

   Using pnpm:

   ```shell
   pnpm run info --web-env
   ```

   Take note of the `SCOPES`, `SHOPIFY_API_KEY` and the `SHOPIFY_API_SECRET` values, as you'll need them in the next steps.

1. Make the following changes to the `fly.toml` file.

   - In the `[env]` section, add the following environment variables (in a `"` delimited string):

     | Variable          | Description/value                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
     | ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
     | `BACKEND_PORT`    | The port on which to run the app; set to the same value as the `EXPOSE` line in the `Dockerfile` (`Dockerfile` default value is `8081`.                                                                                                                                                                  |
     | `HOST`            | Set this to the URL of the new app, which can be constructed by taking the `app` variable at the very top of the `fly.toml` file, prepending it with `https://` and adding `.fly.dev` to the end, e.g, if `app` is `"fancy-cloud-1234"`, then `HOST` should be set to `https://fancy-cloud-1234.fly.dev` |
     | `SCOPES`          | Can be obtained from the `run info --web-env` command in the previous step                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
     | `SHOPIFY_API_KEY` | Can be obtained from the `run info --web-env` command in the previous step                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

   - In the `[[services]]` section, change the value of `internal_port` to match the `BACKEND_PORT` value.

   - Example:

     ```ini
     :
     :
     [env]
       BACKEND_PORT = "8081"
       HOST = "https://fancy-cloud-1234.fly.dev"
       SCOPES = "write_products"
       SHOPIFY_API_KEY = "ReplaceWithKEYFromEnvCommand"

     :
     :

     [[services]]
       internal_port = 8081
     :
     :
     ```

1. Set the API secret environment variable for your app:

   ```shell
   flyctl secrets set SHOPIFY_API_SECRET=ReplaceWithSECRETFromEnvCommand
   ```

1. Build and deploy the app - note that you'll need the `SHOPIFY_API_KEY` to pass to the command

   ```shell
   flyctl deploy --build-arg SHOPIFY_API_KEY=ReplaceWithKEYFromEnvCommand --remote-only
   ```

## Update URLs in Partner Dashboard and test your app

1. Update main and callback URLs in Partner Dashboard to point to new app. The main app URL should point to

   ```text
   https://my-app-name.fly.dev
   ```

   and the callback URL should be

   ```text
   https://my-app-name.fly.dev/api/auth/callback
   ```

1. Test the deployed app by browsing to

   ```text
   https://my-app-name.fly.dev/api/auth?shop=my-dev-shop-name.myshopify.com
   ```

## Deploy a new version of the app

1. After updating your code with new features and fixes, rebuild and redeploy using:

   ```shell
   flyctl deploy --build-arg SHOPIFY_API_KEY=ReplaceWithKEYFromEnvCommand --remote-only
   ```

## To scale to multiple regions

1. Add a new region using `flyctl regions add CODE`, where `CODE` is the three-letter code for the region. To obtain a list of regions and code, run `flyctl platform regions`.
1. Scale to two instances - `flyctl scale count 2`
